✅ Event Calendar Features

📆 Event Categorization
Daily Events: Events that occur every day without a weekday restriction.

Weekly Events: Events that occur only on specific days (e.g., Chaos Castle on Tue/Fri).

🕒 Time Handling
All event times are originally based on CET (Central European Time).

Times are automatically converted to the user’s local time (e.g., CET+2 for you).

Both local time and original CET time are shown for each event.

24-hour time format used everywhere.

⏳ Countdowns
Every event displays a live countdown showing how long until it starts.

Supports countdown across days (e.g., if an event is in 2 days, it’ll show 2d 5h 10m).

Works for both daily and weekly events.

🚀 Up Next
The next upcoming event is shown prominently with its local time and a countdown.
